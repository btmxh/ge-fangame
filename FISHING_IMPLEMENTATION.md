# Fishing System Implementation

This document describes the fishing system implementation for the GE-Fangame project.

## Overview

The game now includes a fishing mode that allows players to cast a fishing line, wait for fish to bite, and catch them. The fishing system is integrated into the existing game modes and can be activated by switching to Fishing mode.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Fishing System** (`ge-app/include/ge-app/game/fishing.hpp`)
   - Manages fishing state machine (Idle, Casting, Fishing, FishBiting, Caught)
   - Handles joystick flick detection for casting
   - Implements line drawing using Bresenham's algorithm
   - Renders bobber with floating and wiggle animations
   - Manages fish bite timing and player interaction

2. **GameScene Integration** (`ge-app/include/ge-app/scenes/game_scene.hpp`)
   - Added fishing system to GameScene
   - Integrated fishing updates in Fishing mode
   - Renders fishing line and bobber when fishing is active
   - Delegates Button A clicks to fishing system

### Fishing States

1. **Idle**: Not fishing, waiting for joystick flick
2. **Casting**: Animated line extending from boat to target position (0.25s with easing)
3. **Fishing**: Line in water, waiting for fish to bite
4. **FishBiting**: Fish is biting, player must react quickly
5. **Caught**: Fish caught, ready to be reeled in with Button A
6. **BaitLost**: Fish got away after eating all the bait, player must reel in empty line
7. **Reeling**: Bobber animating back to boat (0.8s)

## Key Features

### Joystick Flick Detection

- Tracks joystick magnitude change over time to detect "flicking" motion
- Velocity threshold: 3.0 units/second
- Minimum joystick magnitude: 0.4
- Cast distance based on joystick magnitude (up to 80 pixels)
- Cast direction based on joystick angle

### Visual Feedback

1. **Fishing Line**: Drawn using Bresenham's line algorithm in cyan color
   - Animates during casting (extends from boat to target)
   - Animates during reeling (retracts from target to boat)
2. **Bobber**: 3x3 pixel red square with animations:
   - Casting animation: Moves from boat to cast position (0.25s with ease-out cubic)
   - Floating effect: Sinusoidal up/down motion (±2 pixels)
   - Wiggle effect: Circular motion that increases when fish bites
   - Small wiggle (amplitude: 1px) during normal fishing
   - Large wiggle (amplitude: 5px) when fish is biting
   - Reeling animation: Returns to boat (0.8s)

### Fishing Mechanics

1. **Casting**:
   - Flick the joystick to cast in desired direction
   - Distance proportional to joystick magnitude
   - 0.25 second animated casting with smooth easing (line extends to target)

2. **Waiting**:
   - Fish can bite after 2 seconds minimum
   - 30% chance per second for fish to bite
   - Automatic timeout after 15 seconds (fish gets away)

3. **Catching**:
   - Player has 3.5 seconds to press Button A after fish bites
   - 0.5 second reaction time required before catching is possible
   - Visual feedback: Increased wiggle intensity
   - If time runs out: Transitions to BaitLost state with message "The fish ate all the bait and got away!"

4. **Bait Lost**:
   - State entered when fish escapes after eating bait (time expired in FishBiting)
   - Player must press Button A to reel in the empty line
   - Shows "Reeling in empty line..." when reeling starts
   - Provides visual feedback that bait was lost before resetting

5. **Early Retraction**:
   - Player can press Button A during Fishing or FishBiting states
   - Triggers reeling animation immediately
   - Shows "Reeling in early..." message
   - Results in "Nothing caught." after animation completes

6. **Reeling**:
   - 0.8 second animation showing bobber returning to boat
   - Handles three scenarios:
     - Fish caught: Logs fish name
     - Early retraction: Logs "Nothing caught."
     - Bait lost: Logs "Nothing caught."

7. **Rewards**:
   - Random fish or loot printed to stdout (only when caught in time)
   - Possible catches:
     - Tropical Fish
     - Golden Fish (RARE!)
     - Sea Bass
     - Tuna
     - Old Boot (loot)
     - Treasure Chest (RARE loot!)
     - Salmon
     - Pufferfish
     - Clownfish
     - Sardine

### Input Controls

- **Joystick**: Flick to cast fishing line
- **Button 2**: Switch between game modes (Steering/Fishing/Management)
- **Button 1**: 
  - Catch fish when in Caught state (triggers reeling animation with fish)
  - Reel in empty line when in BaitLost state (triggers reeling animation, no catch)
  - Retract early during Fishing/FishBiting states (triggers reeling animation, no catch)

## Implementation Details

### Constants

```cpp
static constexpr float MIN_DELTA_TIME = 0.001f;          // Minimum time step
static constexpr float FLICK_THRESHOLD = 3.0f;           // Velocity for flick
static constexpr float MIN_JOYSTICK_MAG = 0.4f;          // Min joystick magnitude
static constexpr float CAST_DURATION = 0.25f;            // Cast animation time (faster)
static constexpr float REEL_DURATION = 0.8f;             // Reel animation time
static constexpr float BITE_CHANCE_PER_SECOND = 0.3f;    // Fish bite probability
static constexpr float MIN_FISHING_TIME = 2.0f;          // Min wait before bite
static constexpr float MAX_FISHING_TIME = 15.0f;         // Max wait (timeout)
static constexpr float BITE_WINDOW = 3.5f;               // Time to catch fish (3-4s)
static constexpr float CATCH_REACTION_TIME = 0.5f;       // Required reaction time
```

### Easing Functions

**Ease-Out Cubic** (for smooth casting animation):
```cpp
static float ease_out_cubic(float t) {
  float f = t - 1.0f;
  return f * f * f + 1.0f;
}
```

This creates a smooth deceleration effect where the bobber starts fast and slows down as it reaches the target position.

### Animation Details

**Casting Animation (with easing):**
```cpp
float progress = casting_timer / CAST_DURATION;
progress = ease_out_cubic(progress);  // Apply easing
bobber_x = cast_x * progress;  // 0.0 -> 1.0 (smooth)
bobber_y = cast_y * progress;
```

**Reeling Animation:**
```cpp
float progress = reeling_timer / REEL_DURATION;
float inv_progress = 1.0 - progress;  // 1.0 -> 0.0
bobber_x = cast_x * inv_progress;
bobber_y = cast_y * inv_progress;
```

### Line Drawing Algorithm

The fishing line uses Bresenham's line algorithm for efficient pixel-perfect line rendering:
- Draws from boat center to bobber position
- Handles coordinate transformation from relative to screen space
- Clips to screen boundaries automatically
- Updates dynamically during casting and reeling animations

### Bobber Animation

Bobber position is calculated using:
```cpp
wiggle_x = sin(wiggle_time * wiggle_freq) * wiggle_amplitude
wiggle_y = cos(wiggle_time * wiggle_freq * 0.7) * wiggle_amplitude
float_offset = sin(wiggle_time * 2.0) * 2.0
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **No Dynamic Allocation**: All state stored in class members
2. **Efficient Line Drawing**: Uses integer arithmetic (Bresenham)
3. **Minimal State**: Only 7 states in state machine (Idle, Casting, Fishing, FishBiting, Caught, BaitLost, Reeling)
4. **Frame-based Updates**: All animations use delta time
5. **Smooth Animations**: Ease-out cubic easing for casting, linear interpolation for reeling
6. **Fast Casting**: 0.25s casting animation for responsive gameplay

## Files Modified

- `ge-app/include/ge-app/scenes/game_scene.hpp`: Added fishing integration
  - Added `#include "ge-app/game/fishing.hpp"`
  - Added `Fishing fishing;` member
  - Updated `tick()` to handle fishing mode
  - Updated `render()` to draw fishing elements
  - Updated `on_button_clicked()` to handle fishing actions

## Files Added

- `ge-app/include/ge-app/game/fishing.hpp`: Complete fishing system implementation

## Usage

1. **Switch to Fishing Mode**: Press Button 2 to cycle to Fishing mode
2. **Cast Line**: Flick the joystick in the desired direction
   - Watch the animated line extend to the target position with smooth easing (0.25s)
3. **Wait or Retract Early**: 
   - Watch the bobber float and wiggle while waiting for a fish
   - Press Button A anytime to retract early (no catch)
4. **React**: When fish bites (increased wiggle + log message), press Button A within 3.5 seconds
5. **Bait Lost**: If timeout, enters BaitLost state - press Button A to reel in empty line
6. **Reel In**: Watch the bobber animate back to the boat (0.8s)
7. **Success**: Fish name printed to stdout (or "Nothing caught." if retracted early or bait lost)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the fishing system:

1. **Inventory System**: Store caught fish in an inventory
2. **Fish Stats**: Track species, size, rarity, value
3. **Fishing Rod Upgrades**: Different rods with different cast distances
4. **Bait System**: Use different baits to attract specific fish
5. **Fish AI**: More sophisticated fish behavior patterns
6. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for casting, bites, catches
7. **Visual Effects**: Splash animations, ripples in water
8. **Fishing Spots**: Special locations with better fish
9. **Time/Weather Effects**: Fish behavior changes based on conditions
10. **Mini-game**: Button timing challenge when reeling in fish

## Testing

The implementation should be tested to verify:

- [ ] Mode switching works correctly
- [ ] Joystick flick detection is responsive
- [ ] Fishing line renders correctly
- [ ] Bobber floats and wiggles appropriately
- [ ] Fish bite timing is reasonable
- [ ] Button A catches fish when pressed in time
- [ ] Fish names are printed to stdout
- [ ] Timeout works when fish not caught
- [ ] State transitions are smooth
- [ ] Boat still drifts in fishing mode

Note: Due to build environment constraints, full testing requires the Nix development environment or manual setup of SDL3 and build tools. Testing on actual STM32 hardware is recommended for final verification.

## Known Limitations

1. **Random Number Generation**: Currently uses `rand()` which is not thread-safe. For production, consider using C++11 random facilities.
2. **No Inventory**: Caught fish are only printed to stdout, not stored.
3. **Simple Flick Detection**: Velocity-based detection may need tuning based on hardware.
4. **Fixed Bobber Texture**: Uses simple 3x3 red square instead of sprite.
5. **No Sound**: Fishing events are silent (only visual feedback).
