# EP44 lore

**TW: Depression, suicide idealization.**

**Disclaimer**: I accept no responsibility or liability for this document.
Watamates, Sukonbu, as well as the respective VTubers should stay away from
this as far as they could, since this could be considered a "mentally disabled
person projecting their own delusions onto their oshi". I apologize if this might
cause any unnecessary drama, but I firmly assume no legal AND moral responsibility
with this document.

_And so, I’ll keep wishing for that day to come._, more commonly referred to as
the _Suicide EP_, was released on December 31st, 2025 (Comiket 107). Before this
EP, CTB Girls' Dormitory had also released a suicidal album, titled _621 meters
above the sea level._.

Unlike the previous release, the Suicide EP used more "grandiose" and "romantic"
imagery. Despite being shorter (only three songs), the EP was loved because none
of the songs were considered "filler" and massively contributed to the success
of the release.

## Background

Student AB was a student at a prestigious university, but after a disastrous
failure during August 2023, they switched their focus from creative pursuits to
the academic grind. As a result, they made a detailed plan in pursuit of
graduate studies abroad.

Initially, the plan went well with that student getting most of their
"checkboxes" completed. However, during that, they were slowly being corrupted
by the world around them. The student that once believed in a colorful night sky
were no longer hopeful of just a monochrome night sky that was extremely likely
to come true, given the checkboxes that they had acquired. Because of the sudden
rise of work, the student fell into two consecutive suicidal eras in quick
succession.

Which saved them from the second suicidal era was a political ideology of
"giving up". They no longer believed in dreams, hopes or colors. Neither the
colorful night sky nor the monochrome sky matter for them anymore, but at least
they were able to breathe. Perfectly capturing these thoughts was their version
of [Kaishin no Ichigeki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25SoK8liieM).

Yet, those peaceful days did not last long. They tried to balance their work
with their own survival, but that soon collapsed some time in October 2025.
Even after finishing all of their checkboxes, their hopes of getting an
graduate admission remained far lower as it had ever been. This combined with
multiple unrelated incidents (from unlimited deadlines to sensitive topics that
could not be disclosed here) had officially opened the third suicidal era in
that student's history.

## Tsunomaki Watame - Kitto

Back in these peaceful days, student AB used to use lines like "I don't have
such things as dreams/I don't need hope, I don't need love." to steer them away
from their potentially destructive thoughts. They assumed that life was not
worth living in general, but since they could not kill themselves, the only
option left is to continue that balancing act they were having. However, around
this time, a new idea popped up as a result of their catastrophic state of mind.

Kitto, a song originally depicting "gentle resilience" had become twisted into
something far more sinister. Decayism, for the first time, was proposed as a way
to exit from that pitiful state: slowly poisoning oneself until the inevitable
death. Because of this new idea, as well as a starvation attempt, that student
became obsessed with the act of killing themselves.

**LAST WARNING**: This is the final warning. If you are uncomfortable with these
topics, please leave.

During the starvation attempt, the thought of not having to suffer anymore was
the ultimate salvation for that student. For the first time since a long while,
that student had a taste of hope and happiness, whether that was fake or not.
Death was treated as a dream, and this was clearly shown in their version of
Kitto.

Kitto started with a cliched story of a girl finding her dream and failing at
it. The first verse and chorus showed her determination, and the second part of
the song highlighted nothing but her despair. And in an extremely tropey manner,
the final chorus was a retelling of the first chorus, showing that after all
that she had gone through, the girl still yearned for that dream of "reaching
the sky" that she had long longed for.

Of course, putting into this background, there is nothing positive about this.
The song used a clever wordplay to refer to both "death" and the dream using the
same words. Because so, Kitto became the first time that death was truly
romanticized by the student.

## Nishino Kana - Moshimo Unmei No Hito ga Iru No Nara

After the disastrous incident in August 2023, the student became attracted to a
certain imaginary character (in a platonic sense). That character, named M here
for convenience, would become the primary source of inspiration for the
student's creative output since then. A popular Japanese song of this character
was ultimately turned into a "fan-fiction", telling the story of their own life
through a slightly darker lens.

Soon enough, this student began writing a private novel based on the story of
that song. While the original song was just them complaining about their pitiful
life, the so-called novel was a far more well-written piece of literature,
inspired by media they consumed during that time period. After the second
suicidal era, writing this novel became a major motivation for them to keep
living on.

In the first suicidal era of that student, the novel writing process was suspended,
but that does not stop creative works based on it from being made. That student
began to fantasize being reincarnated into that character's world, as documented
in [this commit](https://github.com/btmxh/apartmentapp/commit/7882eb8ba10ce13df4f6ded90b20e9e190d6fd53). This "spin-off" was then be left untouched, until almost one year
later, when that student found out _Moshimo Unmei No Hito ga Iru No Nara_.

The original song by Nishino Kana had a different "vibes" to what that student
usually listened to. They described it as having a "fairytale feeling",
reminding them of what they wrote one year ago. It was inevitable that they
would rewrite that song to expand on the story in the commit.

The start of the song went similarly to what was written in the commit. The
student, in her (the character in the song was explicitly confirmed as female)
past life, was struck by a truck, and miraculously was delivered to M's world.
Retaining her memory from her past life, Rina (the name of the
post-reincarnation girl) followed her sister M around to confirm her prior
knowledge.

It was on these adventures that Rina started to relearn how to live. Her heart
that was once dried out, was now painted with new colors. She even fell
in love with a girl from the supporting cast of the novel (that she herself in
her past life really cherished), showing how much Rina was truly living in this
world.

However, despite Rina's greatest efforts, she and her sister remained powerless
under the reign of the world they both lived in. Bad things were bound to
happen, but even so, at least in this world, they had each other to rely upon.
The final chorus was an event adapted from a canon event in the original manga,
where M was given an umbrella by an unrelated character. In the novel, this same
person was no where to be found, leaving M drenched in the rain alone. However,
in the song parody, Rina, being the author of the story, was there to be by M's
side.

_Moshimo Unmei No Hito ga Iru No Nara_ was not only a love letter of student AB
to M, but also another cry for help. Even in the novel's world, where it was
commonly believed to be a worse-off version of student AB's real world, they
were able to "live", unlike their current self. The romantizing, liveliness of
the song was directly throwing shade at reality.

## Shirakami Fubuki - Glow Embrace

_Glow Embrace_ was discovered an unknown amount of time before the third suicidal
era, but it was only after both Kitto and MoshiUnmei were finalized that the
idea of this song's rewritten version could be completed. While the song could
be interpreted individually (without the other two songs and the psychological
background of student AB), it would lose most of its meaning. Hence, it could be
said that the aforementioned two songs were crucial to the lore of this fangame
project.

The song told a story of an unnamed "sailor" in an imaginary world, who was
implied to have grown bored of her homeland. In this world, there exists two
major continents located at the two poles, and because of the sheer distance,
the two civilizations on these two landmasses were unaware of each other.
However, through some unspecified supernatural means, the narrator heard the
voice of someone coming from the ocean, before coming to the conclusion that she
was talking to someone on the other side of the world.

Time passed, and this unknown girl was the only one who could understand her. It
was then when she had made her mind: she would do anything to meet her soulmate in
person. She tried her best, forging a ship, gathering supplies and head to the
sea. However, luck was not on her side, as a sudden storm forced her to go back home.

The narrator firmly believed that the "next time" would eventually come. But it
did not. She waited and waited, spending time in the hometown that slowly had
driven her insane. From the hopeful girl she once was, the narrator had become
an empty husk that was breathing somehow. For her, the only remaining reason to
live is to meet that soulmate across the ocean, but it seemed like as days
passed, the two of them were further and further apart.

At the end, the powerless narrator begged God to give her a chance. She prayed
and prayed, endlessly, realizing that God was not on her side at all. However,
in the final stanza, what she felt was not despair and hopelessness. Even if God
was not on her side, she firmly believed that she would one day meet her
destined one, and no one, even God himself, could stop such a good ending to
happen. She would soon be united with her soulmate in a world where there was no
longer any pain: heaven itself.

Glow Embrace was successful in combining the message of Kitto (ultimate
romanticization of suicide) with the "love letter" to M as in MoshiUnmei (the
soulmate was a metaphor for M), via an Shelter-style original story. It had
elevated suicide as the ultimate beauty, as the final goal in student AB's life.

## Aftermath

While being clear suicidal propaganda, Glow Embrace ultimately became a major
distraction for student AB. Rather than spiraling in self-destructive thoughts,
they were celebrating the birth of a new legendary song. The original artist,
Shirakami Fubuki, along with her two workers, Tsunomaki Watame and Nakiri Ayame
was followed by this student, giving them a new purpose in life. The sudden
appearance of these three VTubers brought immense levels of positivity into the
student's mindset, effectively undoing years of negative thoughts and failures.
In the end, the Suicide EP was considered to be masterpiece that "saved an
entire generation", rather than a promoter of a self-destructive ideology.
However, this so-called "VTuber bubble" was speculated to inevitably burst, and
when that day comes, maybe a fourth suicidal era would be bound to happen.
