# Asset credits

Since I can't really draw and rearrange music, most of the assets that I "made"
for this project are heavily based on existing works by other people. This will
be updated as I add more assets to the project.

## Fonts

- [ProggyClean](https://github.com/bluescan/proggyfonts) (currently unused).
- [Pixeloid](https://ggbot.itch.io/pixeloid-font) (planned as main font).

## BGM

- `ambient-bgm` is a rearrangement of Shirakami Fubuki's
  [Glow Embrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWEmA6AxIyM&list=RDBWEmA6AxIyM)
  (soty 2025 winner yay).
  - Piano notes are arranged based on
    [this piano cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIZMn2jcgmQ).
  - Noises (removed) are arranged based on
    [this drum cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5z_OdGznFk).
- `menu-bgm` is a very crude rearrangement of Tsunomaki Watame's
  [Kitto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVAf4gRZro0&list=RDdVAf4gRZro0)
  (only a loop from the instrumental).

## Textures

Currently, all are hand-drawn using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
